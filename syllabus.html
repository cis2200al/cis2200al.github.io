<h3>Hybrid Model</h3>
<p>Please note that this course is offered as a hybrid course. That means, instead of meeting face-to-face for two and half hours every week (both Mondays &amp; Wednesdays), we will be meeting for about an hour and a quarter, only on Mondays. This also means that you will be completing online work to compensate for the hour and quarter for which we will not be meeting face-to-face. The course website will identify the various types of assignments that you should complete outside of the class.</p>
<p>A hybrid class also means that a lot of communication would happen when we are outside of our class. You should visit the course website <strong>at least twice a week</strong> to check for any updates that I might have posted.</p>
<p>Please note that a hybrid model requires good discipline and time management as there will be work to be done every week. Much of the online work will be fun explorations of technology and will help you learn in a self-paced way.</p>
<h3>Assignments, Projects, &amp; Quizzes</h3>
<p>Throughout the semester students will be expected to complete homework assignments, which will help them practice the concepts learned in class. The students will also be expected to complete group projects, where they will have to use their skills to solve a complex business problem that requires the development of a spreadsheet and a database.</p>
<p>There will also be ad-hoc in-class questions, exercises, and quizzes. In-class assignments and quizzes have to be submitted before the end of class to receive credit, unless specified otherwise by the instructor. </p>
<p>Instructions for the homework assignments and quizzes will be made available through the course website as and when necessary. Students should periodically check (at least twice a week) the course website for any updates.</p>
<h3>Exams</h3>
<p>Exams will consist of a combination of true/false and multiple choice questions.  Exams will cover material from all aspects of the class sessions (lectures, software demonstrations, discussions, videos, extra handouts, etc.)</p>
<h3>Attendance and Participation</h3>
<p>Students are expected to attend all classes, read the assigned readings before the lectures, and participate actively in class sessions. Attendance and participation are important elements of the class.  Although no direct grade is assigned to attendance, class participation affects your grades as shown in the course grade distribution table above.  Ad hoc in-class questions and assignments will affect the class participation grade.  Absence during ad-hoc in-class exercises will affect your grades.  If you miss any class, it is your responsibility to make-up for whatever you miss.</p>
<h3>Grading Scale</h3>
<p>Letter grades are calculated according to the following table.  The instructor reserves the right to curve this scale, if deemed necessary.</p>

<h2>Course Policies</h2>
<h3>Exams</h3>
<p><strong>Missing Exams</strong>: No make-ups will be given for missed exams. In case of extraordinary circumstances, students who cannot attend an exam must contact the instructor in advance and provide a justification for their absence.</p>
<p><strong>Checking Exam Scores</strong>: Students will have an opportunity to check their graded exams but the instructor retains all midterm and final exams.</p>
<p><strong>Final Exam's Time</strong>: All students must take the final exam in the time slot posted in the college bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>Exams' content</strong>: The exam will include material from both the readings and from the topics covered in the lectures. Some of the lecture material may not be found in the book. Therefore, it is very important to attend classes regularly and keep up with the pace of the reading assignments.</p>
<p><strong>Exam-Taking Conduct</strong>: Behavior during exams is expected to conform to Baruch College guidelines. Any form of cheating or communications with other students or any other improper behavior will be dealt according to the guidelines established by the College.</p>
<p><strong>Penalties for cheating range from an F on the exam, to an F on the course, as well as notification to the Dean of the College.</strong></p>
<h4>Note:</h4>
<p><strong>I take academic integrity very seriously. There will be no form of leniency from me for any kind of cheating or collusion in the violations of exam rules. You are required to check the Academic Integrity statement section below and visit the listed link to read in details the College's policy regarding this matter.</strong></p>
<h3>Class Attendance</h3>
<p>Class participation is an important element of the course grade, so make every effort to attend class lectures, during which you can participate in answering questions, completing exercises and quizzes.</p>
<p><strong>Classroom Conduct:</strong> To avoid disruption, you should arrive at the classroom on time. Cell phones and all other electronic devices should be turned off or at least silenced during class and exams.</p>
<p>In addition, you are expected to be respectful of the instructor and other students during class lectures. Conversations and work unrelated to the class lectures' content need to be reserved for time outside of class.</p>
<p><strong>Missing class</strong>: If you miss class, it is your responsibility to find out about any announcements or assignments you may have missed.</p>
<h3>Work Submission Standards</h3>
<p><strong>Late Work</strong>: If you are instructed to submit assignments through blackboard’s assignment submission system, then you must do so before the deadline specified.  Late submissions will incur penalties as described in earlier sections or in assignment instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Essential Requirements</strong>: Hand-written work will not be acceptable and will earn no credit. As with any other academic submission, students must do their work carefully, striving to achieve high quality. This includes writing clearly, checking spelling and grammar, proofreading the submissions, and handing in the work on or before the specified due date.</p>
<p><strong>Extensions</strong>: Extensions may be granted for situations involving illness or personal emergencies. If you need an extension, you must request one in writing or via e-mail before the due date of an assignment. </p>
<p>NOTE: Extensions will not be granted for problems relating to use of home or workplace computer systems (please use the BCTC facilities to avoid such problems).</p>
<p><strong>Work Integrity:</strong> Some assignments may require individual work while others may require team work.  Any instance of copying, cheating or plagiarism in individual assignments or group projects will result in penalties. Students (or teams) handing in similar work may receive a zero in the assignment/project and/or a failing grade in the course, and will face disciplinary actions.</p>
<h3>Academic Integrity Statement</h3>
<p>The CIS Department fully supports Baruch College’s policy on Academic Honesty, which states, in part: </p>
<p><strong>“Academic dishonesty is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Cheating, forgery, plagiarism, and collusion in dishonest acts undermine the college’s educational mission and the students’ personal and intellectual growth. Baruch students are expected to bear individual responsibility for their work and to uphold the ideal of academic integrity. Any student who attempts to compromise or devalue the academic process will be sanctioned.”</strong></p>
<p>Additional information can be found at http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/academic/academic_honesty.htm/.</p>
<h3>Research Requirement</h3>
<p>You will need to earn 1 hour of out-of-class research-based assignments. The purpose of these assignments is to provide the student with experience in Information Systems research. </p>
<p><strong>Options:</strong> There are two options for completing these assignments and you can complete the required credits through a combination of these two options: (a) Participating in Information Systems research studies for 1 hour of participation time; &amp; (b) Writing a 500-word essay on how Information Technology has changed the way in which individuals, businesses or society operates nowadays.</p>
<p>Meaning, you have 3 ways of satisfying the research requirement: (1) You can participate in 1 hour of research studies (there are studies that range from 30 minutes to 1 hour); or (2) write the 500-word essay; or (3) partipate in 30 minutes of research study <em>and</em> write a 250-word essay.</p>
<p>Details about the options are below.</p>
<h4>Participation in IS researh studies</h4>
<p>You can sign up for IS research studies which range from 30 minutes to 1 hour on the CIS SONA website (http://baruch-cis.sona-systems.com/). Each half an hour segment counts as <em>one</em> point. Therefore, to fulfill the one hour requirement, you must obtain two points in the CIS SONA system.</p>
<p>Please note that the CIS SONA system operates independently from other SONA systems used for other departments (such as Management or Psychology).</p>
<p>You must be at least 18 years of age to participate in a study.   </p>
<p>When signing up for studies, please remember: (a) to print the page with the name, date, place, and time of the study and the experimenter’s name (keep this information until the end of the semester); and (b) to cancel though the website before the scheduled time if you cannot make the study.</p>
<p><strong><em>Log-in Information</em></strong> Your password for the CIS SONA system will be emailed to your Baruch email account within 2 weeks of the start of class. If you forget your password, go to http://baruch-cis.sona-systems.com/ and use the password recovery link on the left hand side of the welcome screen. </p>
<p><em><strong>Disputes &amp; Participation Decision</strong></em> If you have any disputes about your participation in a study, you should contact the experimenter directly. According to the ethical guidelines, participation is voluntary and individuals may withdraw from a study, at any time, without penalty to that individual.</p>
<h4>Writing an essay</h4>
<p><strong>References</strong> Your essay should include at least one reference from the press or from business magazines. You are required to make sure that your sources are properly referenced in your essay according to the APA guidelines.</p>
<p><strong><em>Word Count Requirement</em></strong> Remember, 500 words count as 1 hour, and so 250 words count as half an hour.</p>
<p><strong><em>Submission</em></strong> Essays must be submitted through turnitin.com to be considered as an alternative to the research requirements. Guidelines and submission details are available at the SONA-FAQ section.</p>
<p>Please note that credits earned for other courses in Psychology, Marketing or Management cannot be applied to the IS &amp; Stats Department requirement.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the CIS Research Requirement guidelines, please send an email to the Participant Pool Manager, Prof. Isak Taksa at: cisresearch@baruch.cuny.edu, or isak.taksa@baruch.cuny.edu.</p></p>
